TestNG Eclipse Plugin Installation Instructions

We are going to be using TestNG for unit testing and integration testing.  
You will be able to run these test suites from an ant build file (which is 
what the continuous build server will do).  However, if you want to execute 
them from the Eclipse IDE (and debug into them) you will need the plug in.  

Here is the link:

   1. Install the plug in (see me if you have problems).
   2. Go to “Open Debug Dialog” (or “Open Run Dialog”)
   3. Right click on TestNG
   4. Click new
   5. Give the configuration a name
   6. Ensure that mpower is the project that is selected
   7. Select the “Suite” radio button and ensure that “test\testng.xml” is in the field
   8. Click on the JRE tab and make sure that the project JRE is selected
   9. Click Apply and Close
  10. Open Window/Preferences and select TestNG
  11. In the output directory put “./build/stage/test-folder”

You are now ready to execute a TestNG suite from Eclipse.
