 * 					The recommendation by the orange leap team is that before you try and add a payment source to a gift, you
 * 					first do a lookup of existing payment sources to determine it does not currently exist.  If it does currently
 * 					exist you would use this payment source instead of creating a new one.
 * 					
 * 					If you try and create a new payment source that already exists you will receive a SoapFault.
